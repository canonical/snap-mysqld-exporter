    """A python service object used to run the mysqld-exporter.

    This service runs the mysqld-exporter server. It will take into
    consideration the current snap configuration and determine which
    stats to enable or disable. By default, all stats are disabled
    except for those that are associated with userstat=1.

    This service will also take into account additional metrics which
    need to be turned off. To disable these, simply run the command

    $ sudo snap set mysqld-exporter collect.<grouping>.<metric>=false

    As a note, the 'grouping' and 'metric' keys will replace all underscores
    ('_') with a hyphen ('-') in the snap configuration. For example, to
    disable collection of the collect.info_schema.innodb_metrics, one would
    run:

    $ sudo snap set mysqld-exporter collect.info-schema.innodb-metrics

    This will result in the mysqld-exporter being run as follows:

    $ mysqld-exporter --no-collect.info_schema.innodb_metrics
